# Electron Keyboard

Haha! Funny pun!

This will be my second electron app so far!

I made it to better apply some javascript skills and to have fun!

Hope you'll enjoy it!

# Steps:

1. After cloning it, start npm with "npm install"
2. then use npm run build to build the app in your platform!
3. The outcome should be at your downloads folder.

# Attention!

The process should take some minutes to set up, but at the end, you should end up with a nice little app that generates very diverse passwords!

It works from the tray so whenever you run it, make sure to pay attention to it!

P.S.: Fixed the dark icon!
