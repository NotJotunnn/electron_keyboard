# Electron Keyboard

Haha! Funny pun!

This will be my second electron app so far!

I made it to better apply some javascript skills and to have fun!

Hope you'll enjoy it!

# Steps:

1. After cloning it, start npm with "npm install"
2. then use npm run build to build the app in your platform!
3. The outcome should be at your downloads folder.

# Attention!

For now this app has compatibility issues with any platform that isn't mac or linux.

The process should take some minutes to set up, but at the end, you should end up with a 24 keys piano!

It works from the tray so whenever you run it, make sure to pay attention to it!

P.S.: No more dark stroke-only icons!
